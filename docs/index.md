This project is in no way affiliated with [`basketball-reference.com`](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) (and I 
hope the fine folks at **Basketball Reference** do not get too upset at me for creating and maintaining this project).

Please use this project responsibly as **Basketball Reference** is a very useful resource.

## Background

This library was created for another Python project where I was trying to estimate an NBA player's productivity 
(for, uh, ~~daily fantasy sports~~ "science").

A lot of sports-related APIs are expensive - luckily, **Basketball Reference** provides a free service which can be scraped 
and translated into a usable API.
